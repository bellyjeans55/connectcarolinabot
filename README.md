# connectcarolinabot

Automated course registry for UNC's ConnectCarolina system. Uses an emulated browser to logon to a given ConnectCarolina
account. It proceeds to check which user-specified classes are open, and register the user for each. If there is a scheduling
conflict, the program reports back to the user and continues to register for the remaining of the entered classes.
